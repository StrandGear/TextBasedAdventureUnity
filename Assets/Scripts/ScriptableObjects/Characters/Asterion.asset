        because they paid him, but no one believes me! He used me and now I am dishonored

        noding your head. "I see. You know, if you wanna be better in fight with
        him you should be fast. He wears a heavy armor so he is bad at dodging quick
        attacks. Sorry I didn''t see him fighting a lot. Well, wish you luck in your
        deal, my duty calls me!"'
