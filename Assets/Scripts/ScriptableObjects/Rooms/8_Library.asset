  description: "The knight's library in the castle is a majestic haven of wisdom
    and heritage. Tall shelves adorned with ancient tomes line the walls, while soft
    candlelight bathes the space in a warm glow. Plush chairs invite visitors to
    linger and explore, while a grand oak table stands at the center, a symbol of
    scholarly gatherings of knights past. Above a crackling fireplace hangs a tapestry
    depicting the castle's founders, a reminder of the rich legacy that resides within
    these walls. (next)\r"
