  description: A beautiful majestic castle is facing you. Here you can see sparkles
    of magics fights are training, piles of books on the benches under trees, everyone
    is armored. Everything is over neat and definitely gives you a feeling that it's
    a higher status place, not for someone like you. People are smiling, laughing,
    training, reading. Windows show sneaks of big library inside. Your gut is pleased.
