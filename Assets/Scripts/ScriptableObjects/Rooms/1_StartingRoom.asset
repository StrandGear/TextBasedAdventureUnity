  description: 'Several years ago my father had been cowardly murdered. Now I am
    finally ready to avenge him.

    All fault is laying on our knighthood, who
    started abusing their status and direct power to solve their personal problems.
    I will teach them a lesson. I will kill that murderer and maybe get rid of some
    other corrupted knights. '
