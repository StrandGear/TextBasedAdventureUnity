  description: "\rThe castle's main hall is a breathtaking tableau of knightly splendor.
    Tall stone arches stretch towards a ceiling adorned with heroic carvings, while
    sunlight dances through stained glass windows, casting vibrant hues across the
    polished marble floor.\n \nIt is a place where the echoes of chivalry's past
    resound, inspiring all who enter with a sense of awe and reverence.\r"
